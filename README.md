# Startupper

A platform where founders, investors, and early users build together.

## Overview

Startupper is a Flutter app that connects three types of users in the startup ecosystem:
- **Founders** - Build and grow startups, find investors and talent
- **Investors** - Discover and fund promising startups  
- **End-users** - Join startups, freelance, or test products

## Current Implementation

### 🎨 Complete Onboarding Flow

**7 screens with polished UI:**

1. **Auth Screen** (`/auth`)
   - Email and password fields
   - Login and signup functionality
   - Clean, centered card design

2. **Role Selection** (`/onboarding/reason`)
   - "Why are you joining?" question
   - 3 interactive role cards (Founder, Investor, End-user)
   - Polished cards with elevation, gradients, and glow effects
   - Continue button disabled until selection
   - No back button (came from login)

3. **Common Onboarding** (`/onboarding/common`)
   - Profile picture upload (camera or gallery)
   - Full name, headline, and location fields
   - Freelancing availability toggle
   - Back chevron navigation
   - Routes to role-specific screens

4. **Founder Onboarding** (`/onboarding/founder`)
   - Startup name and one-liner pitch (300 char limit)
   - Stage selection dropdown
   - Multi-select chips: what you're looking for (no checkmarks)
   - Optional expandable "Product Details" section:
     - Yes/No question-based toggle
     - Website, demo video, App Store ID, Play Store ID fields
   - Back and Finish navigation

5. **Investor Onboarding** (`/onboarding/investor`)

   - Back and Finish navigation

7. **Feed Screen** (`/feed`, `lib/feed/feed_screen.dart`)
   - Hero featured strip with horizontal cards
   - Main feed list with card variants:
     - Update cards (metrics, ask chips, applause/comment/interest actions)
     - Startup highlights (tags, metrics, asks, CTA)
     - Missions/tasks (reward badge, tags, claim/save CTAs)
     - Investor spotlights (thesis, tags, intro/share CTAs)
   - Filter chips row and role-accented styling
   - Pull-to-refresh and auto load-more near scroll end
   - Feed repository now fetches from Supabase `feed_items` (no mock fallback)
   - Debug-only “Add sample item” action in feed AppBar to seed `feed_items`

### ✨ Key Features

  - Circular avatar with border
- ✅ Character limits on text fields (300 chars for pitch)
- ✅ Multi-line text inputs where appropriate
- ✅ Proper keyboard types (URL, email, number)
- ✅ Required field indicators (*)
- ✅ Inline validation on auth/onboarding forms; navigation gated on validity
- ✅ Supabase auth wired (sign up/login)

### 📦 Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter: sdk
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  image_picker: ^1.0.4      # Profile picture uploads
  supabase_flutter: ^2.5.5  # Supabase auth, database, storage
```

## Backend Schema (Supabase)

- See `supabase/schema.sql` for tables, indexes, and RLS policies (profiles, role details, feed_items).
- Create a project in Supabase, copy `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, apply `supabase/schema.sql` via SQL editor or `supabase db push`, then run the app with the dart-defines above.

### Supabase Setup Checklist

1. **Apply database schema:**
   - Run `supabase/schema.sql` in SQL Editor (tables, indexes, RLS policies, storage policies)
   - Reset API cache (Settings → API → Reset cache) after creating tables/policies

2. **Create Storage bucket for avatars:**
   - Go to Storage → New bucket → Name: `avatars`
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Enable "Public bucket"** toggle (required for public URL access)
   - The storage policies in `schema.sql` handle authenticated upload/update/delete
   - Avatar files are stored at `{user_id}.{ext}` (e.g., `abc123-def456.png`)

3. **Configure Auth redirect URL:**
   - Use a deep link (e.g., `startupper://auth-callback`) or HTTPS URL you control
   - Add it to Authentication → URL Configuration → Site URL and Redirect URLs

4. **Run the app with dart-defines:**
   ```bash
   flutter run \
     --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=<your-project-url> \
     --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key> \
     -d <device>
   ```
   Optional:
   - `--dart-define=SUPABASE_EMAIL_REDIRECT=<redirect-url>` for email verification
   - `--dart-define=BYPASS_VALIDATION=true` for testing

## Architecture

**Navigation Structure:**
```
AuthScreen
    ↓ (pushReplacementNamed)
ReasonScreen
    ↓ (pushNamed)
CommonOnboardingScreen
    ↓ (pushNamed, role-based)
[FounderOnboarding | InvestorOnboarding | EndUserOnboarding]
    ↓ (pushReplacementNamed)
FeedScreen
```

**State & Data:**
- Local state with StatefulWidget and setState()
- TextEditingController for form inputs
- Route arguments for passing selected role
- Supabase persistence via `services/supabase_service.dart`
  - Auth screen ensures a `profiles` row on signup/login
  - Common onboarding: upserts profile and uploads avatar to `avatars` bucket (public URL stored in `profiles.avatar_url`)
  - Role onboarding: upserts to `founder_details`, `investor_details`, or `enduser_details`
- Feed data fetched from Supabase `feed_items` via `feed_repository.dart` (includes author avatar URLs from joined `profiles` table)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
- [x] Add form validation (required fields, email format)
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Integrate Supabase authentication (sessions, redirects) end-to-end
- [x] Set up Supabase Storage for profile pictures (bucket `avatars`, public URLs working)
- [x] Save user profiles to Supabase database (profile upsert + avatar upload working)
- [x] Move feed data to a service layer and wire to backend when ready
- [ ] Add empty/skeleton states for feed loading/empty
- [ ] Wire feed inserts/search/filter to Supabase (fetch now uses `feed_items`; inserts seeded via debug action)
- [ ] Session-aware routing to skip onboarding when profile/role exists

### Feature Development
- [ ] Build out the feed screen with real content (Supabase or API)
- [ ] Implement startup discovery and browsing
- [ ] Add user profile viewing and editing
- [ ] Create founder-investor matching
- [ ] Add messaging/communication features
- [ ] Implement search and filtering

### Polish & Optimization
- [ ] Add app icons and splash screens
- [ ] Implement proper error messages
- [ ] Add onboarding progress indicator
- [ ] Optimize images and performance
- [ ] Add analytics and monitoring

## Platform Support

- ✅ iOS (tested on iPhone)
- ✅ macOS (tested on Mac desktop)
- ⏳ Android (platform files not yet added)
- ⏳ Web (platform files not yet added)

## Development Notes

- Auth/onboarding code is split into feature files under `lib/auth` and `lib/onboarding`; app shell routes live in `main.dart`
- No external state management (Provider, Riverpod, etc.) yet
- Inline form validation implemented; can be bypassed for testing with `--dart-define=BYPASS_VALIDATION=true`
- Supabase integration working for auth, profiles, role details, feed items, and avatar storage
- Profile images uploaded to Supabase Storage (`avatars` bucket) with public URLs
- Feed repository includes debug logging (`dart:developer`) for troubleshooting
